# Python-WK5-Assignment
# Activity 1:
1. Creation of a class representing furniture
2. Addition of attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
3. Use of constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
4. Addition of an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

# Activity 2:
Creation of a program that includes vehicles with the same action (like move()). 
However, it makes each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" üöó, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ‚úàÔ∏è).
